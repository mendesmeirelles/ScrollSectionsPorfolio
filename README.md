# Gabe's Scroll Sections Portfolio
we would like you to provide a solution created
with React:
- We have a page that contains a navigation area with 3 links, each linking to a section
- Below that, 3 sections (eg. with a text paragraph) after each other.
- 
The main challenge is the navigation area with the section links, here we want the following behavior:
- The navigation area is sticky, so it remains on top of the page when the user scrolls
- 
- If a user scrolls to a section and the section is higher than 50% of the visible window, the corresponding link to the section should be indicated as active (eg. with an underline or a highlighted color)


To run the app:

1. `npm install`
2.  `npm start` 
3.  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
